This is a pretty bare-bones starter template for a React app that I like to use. It uses Parcel as a bundler, and uses SCSS for styling.

## Setup

Clone the repository.

`$ git clone https://github.com/evanwinter/starter-react my-react-app && cd my-react-app`

Install the dependencies.

`$ npm install`

Run the app locally.

`$ npm start`

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:1234.
